Whoever wants to feel the serene beauty of Nepal, must visit Mustang. I would definately recommend trek lovers to trek around mustang despite of several challenges. The best season to travel Mustang is October and November because we can see the pure beauty of landscapes, waterfalls, hills and so on under the sun. The worst thing we can do, is trvelling to Mustang in rainy season. I should admit that the condition of roads towards Mustang is not safe. Along with my 6 friends, we made a trip to Muktinath Temple and we had to travel through Mustang which was an awesome experience in terms of landscapes and natural beauty. Here's how our travel begun...

We were altogether 7 people, 6 friends and 1 driver. We reserved a Scorpio and travelled from Kathmandu to Muktinath Temple and back to Kathmandu within 5 days. We went from Kathmandu -> Pokhara -> Beni -> Tatopani -> Mustang -> Jomsom -> Muktinath Temple and came back through the same way. An important highlight of this travel (specially for me) was swimming in a hot water swimming pool at Tatopani (at 9:30 pm), visiting Dhumba Lake in Jomsom and being faint for few seconds near Muktinath due to altitude sickness :)
