Whoever wants to feel the serene beauty of Nepal, must visit Mustang. I would definately recommend trek lovers to trek around mustang despite of several challenges. Best season to travel Mustang is October and November because we can see the pure beauty of landscapes, waterfalls, hills and so on under the sun. The worst thing we can do, is trvelling to Mustang in rainy season. I should admit that the condition of roads towards Mustang is not safe. Along with my 6 friends, we made a trip to Muktinath Temple and we had to travel through Mustang which was an awesome experience in terms of landscapes and natural beauty.
