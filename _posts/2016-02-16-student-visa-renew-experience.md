This post aims to provide information about the process of renewing student visa based on my  personal experience.

If you are studying in Technical University Of Munich (TUM) or LMU or any other university based in Munich you should process all your government related works (eg. renew visa, address registration, applying residence permit etc ) from Kreiseverwaltungsreferat(KVR) located in Rupperstrasse 19, 80337 Munich.

According to the opening schedule of KVR on Tuesday ( 8.30 – 12 Uhr und 14 – 18 ) , I reached KVR at 8:40 am and asked reception about the place to renew my student visa. It was Wartezone 8 on 2nd floor. Reception in Wartezone 8 asked me show my passport, enrolment paper and bank statement just to confirm that I had all the required documents. She gave me a form to fill up and a token no. to wait for my turn.
After certain time, I went to the room near by the Wartezone 8 as mentioned in the digital notice board. I was asked to show following documents

- passport
- existing residence permit
- enrolment certificate from the university
- transcript with credits from the university
- bank statement
- student job contract(optional)
- health insurance card

After verifying these documents, she gave me an application letter and asked me to submit it to the reception in area number 1073 on first floor. She kept my existing residence permit because it was supposed to be printed on my passport. I asked her, is it ok to carry photo copy of visa while travelling within munich and she said we are allowed to so.  Finally, I had to submit this application letter with 30 EUR and passport and I was give a token number to wait for my turn. After 10 min I received visa on my passport with 1 year of extension.

I was lucky that all these process only took  1 and half hours.

I hope this post will be helpful to others with similar situation.
